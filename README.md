# Introduction

Hotklicker is a software made in Rust that allows for setting hotkeys that will execute actions with the mouse.

Actions can be defined with great flexibility as a sequence of commands that move the mouse and can click with modifier keys.

An example of how to set up the hotkeys can be seen in this project's config.yml.
